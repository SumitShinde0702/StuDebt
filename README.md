# StuDebt (now known as XFund)

Empowering Students. Connecting Companies. Funding Futures.

---

XFund is a next-generation platform that connects students seeking educational funding with companies willing to sponsor their education in exchange for future work commitments. By leveraging blockchain technology (XRPL) and a transparent offer system, XFund creates a win-win ecosystem for students and companies alike.

## 🚀 Project Overview

**XFund** enables students to create loan requests for their education, and companies to make sponsorship offers. Students can review, accept, or reject offers, and once an agreement is reached, the process is managed transparently on-chain using XRPL escrow and NFT technology.

## 🌟 Key Features

- **Student Loan Requests:** Students can create, save as draft, edit, and manage loan requests for their education.
- **Company Sponsorships:** Companies can browse open requests, make offers, and manage active sponsorships.
- **Offer & Counter-Offer System:** Multiple companies can make offers; students can accept, reject, or let offers expire.
- **Agreement Management:** Once an offer is accepted, a blockchain-backed agreement is created, with payment and work terms tracked transparently.
- **Role-Based Dashboards:** Separate, intuitive dashboards for students and companies.
- **Profile Management:** Both students and companies can manage their profiles and upload relevant documents.
- **Modern UI/UX:** Built with React, Material UI, and responsive design for a seamless experience.
